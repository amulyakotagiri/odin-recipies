     <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Lasagna is an Italian baked pasta dish made by layering wide,
         flat pasta sheets with fillings such as ragù (meat and tomato sauce), béchamel (white sauce),
         cheeses like ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan, and vegetables, then baking it until bubbly and browned. 
         The dish can refer to both the layered baked casserole and the specific type of wide, flat pasta used to make it.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water (Optional)</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients</li>

        <li>Combining the dough:</li>
            <p>
                Combine flour and salt in a medium bowl. Make a well in the center and add beaten egg.
                Mix well until a stiff dough forms, adding up to 2 tablespoons water if needed.
            </p>
        <li>Kneading dough:</li>
            <p>
              Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth,
              3 to 4 minutes. Wrap dough and let rest for 30 minutes to 1 hour.
            </p>
        <li>Rolling:</li>
            <p>
               Roll dough by hand or with a pasta machine to desired thickness, 
               then cut into strips of desired width and length.
